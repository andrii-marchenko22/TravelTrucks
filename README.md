# TravelTrucks

[Visit Project](https://travel-trucks-serg.vercel.app/)

## Overview

**TravelTrucks** is the frontend part of a web application for a camper rental company. The app allows users to browse the camper catalog, view detailed information and reviews for individual campers, and submit booking requests.

The goal of the project is to provide a modern and user-friendly interface for searching and booking campers.

---

## Key Features

- Search campers by **location**.
- Filter by **vehicle type** and **equipment**.
- Browse the **full camper catalog**.
- View **detailed information** for individual campers.
- Display **user reviews**.
- **Booking form** with validation and helpful user prompts.
- Add campers to **favorites**.

---

## API Endpoints

The frontend communicates with the backend using the following endpoints:

- **GET /campers** - fetch all camper listings.  
  Filtering (by location, type, or equipment) is handled **on the backend**, not on the frontend.

- **GET /campers/:id** - fetch details of a specific camper by its unique ID.

---

## Routing

The project uses Next.js App Router for page navigation:

- `/` - **Home page**, featuring the search form for campers.
- `/catalog` - **Catalog page**, displaying all campers with filtering options.
- `/catalog/:id` - **Camper detail page**, showing features, reviews, and booking form.
